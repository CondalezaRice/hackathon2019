# The plan

## UI

### Main ( Challenge ) page
- Timer: show how much time is left.
- Progress: show how much you have completed ( maybe like a dope progress bar )
- Real-time stats: WPM, error count ( backspaces? ), score ( to make it more like a game ), acheivements ( dont mess up for 50 words etc )
- Text?: Lets show some cool inspirational messages to keep people into this ( HIGH SCORE, BONUS POINTS, Halo style "Unstoppable" )

## Typing event handling
As it sounds, add more later

## Statistics

### What to include:
- WPM
- Error count ( if word wrong || backspace )
- Score
- Time
- Acheivements as part of statistics
